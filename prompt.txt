Steps for analysis:
Step 1: Identify any user input variables. User inputs are often targeted for XSS attacks.
Step 2: Examine how user inputs are handled and sanitized. Lack of proper sanitization may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
Step 3: Check if user inputs are dynamically inserted into the HTML output without proper encoding. This can allow malicious scripts to be executed.
Step 4: Determine if there are any security measures in place, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), which can mitigate XSS risks.

Using the above steps, provide a detailed reasoning to determine if the input code snippet is vulnerable to XSS attacks, and explain why based on the findings.
