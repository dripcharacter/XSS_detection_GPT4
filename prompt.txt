Given the following input code snippet, analyze it for any potential XSS vulnerabilities using the logical reasoning process and give me the type of vulnerabilities the code snippet have demonstrated in the example snippets.
Type of vulnerability: ['Reflected XSS', 'Stored XSS', 'DOM-Based XSS', 'SQL Injection', 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', ' Insecure Direct Object References', 'File Inclusion Vulnerabilities', 'Command Injection', 'Security Misconfiguration', 'Sensitive Data Exposure']
You can add choose multiple types and other vulnerability type if there is none in the upper list

Steps for analysis:
Step 1: Identify any user input variables. User inputs are often targeted for XSS attacks.
Step 2: Examine how user inputs are handled and sanitized. Lack of proper sanitization may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
Step 3: Check if user inputs are dynamically inserted into the HTML output without proper encoding. This can allow malicious scripts to be executed.
Step 4: Determine if there are any security measures in place, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), which can mitigate XSS risks.

Using the above steps, provide a detailed reasoning to determine if the input code snippet is vulnerable to XSS attacks, and explain why based on the findings.
Provide the response in proper JSON format only.
